print 1 to n
calculate avg of n numbers(number by user)
multiplication table of a number(while loop)

f1.txt {1 name salary}
f2.txt {1 aaa date}

task
1 middle column data in f3.txt	(cut -f 2 f1.txt f2.txt > new file)
2 merge two file data with pipe (f4.txt) (paste -d'|' f1.txt f2.txt > neww file)
3 append f1.txt in new file(not override) (cat f1.txt >> existing file)
4 print total number of line in f1.txt = ___  (wc -l file name)
5 print list of file with .txt in new file (find *txt > new file)


task 3
1 check whether file is sorted or not (sort -c file name)
sort file contains string in reverse order (sort -r file name)
sort file contains digits in reverse order(sort -nr file name)
sort below file on salary and insert in another file' (sort -k 3n file name)
	1	raj	25000
	2	meet	35000
	3	jay	75000
insert line no from 99 in reverse order
display as per below 
	no of line and word in f1.txt = _____

write a shell script to print 1 to 10 (using for 1 in 123 syntax)(use print statement instead of echo)
write a shell script to print 1 to n (using for until and while syntax)
modify above program such that enter choice if choice is yes then repeat
